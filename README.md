# Calculator App

A simple and responsive calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project performs basic arithmetic operations and offers a clean UI inspired by real-world calculators.

> ✅ This project was created as part of my internship to practice frontend web development concepts.

# Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6)

---
# How It Works

- All button clicks are handled using JavaScript event listeners
- The expression is evaluated using the `eval()` function
- Input display is aligned to the **right** for real calculator feel
- CSS handles layout, responsiveness, and shadow effects

# Note on `eval()`

This project uses `eval()` to evaluate mathematical expressions for simplicity.  
In production-grade apps, using `eval()` is **not recommended** due to security risks.
